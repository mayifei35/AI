	MarioMyAgent.java is from the super mario game. The algorithm has some heuristics built in, nothing intelligent.                     
	BFS DFS, iDFS and AStar are from the sliding puzzle game. BFS uses a queue, DFS stack. Astar estimates the cost by adding up the moves to get to the current state and minimum moves to get to the goal.                                                         
	DFSBot is from the othello game. I attemped to build the bot using Astar but it didn't work out. Right now it implements dfs. It still needs debugging.
	
	layer.py is from the brest cancer prediction.It implements an artificial neural network. Right now it let the inputs passes through for one time and backpropagate for one time. The matrices stop to be aligned for the second time.
	
	movie.py is the movie cluster program. It groups similar movies together by calculating the avergae score of each movie.I'm stuck on creating movie vectors that have scores at the correspoding position.
	
	linear_regression.py is using a linear regression model that predicts stock market based on temperature.
	
	GA.java is the genetic algorithm that creates polygons and reproduce new ones to recreate an image. It has a NullPointerException when it runs.
